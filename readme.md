# ITransition Course Project

## You have to implement a Web application for customisable forms (quizzes, tests, questionnaires, polls, etc.). Something similar to Google Forms. Users define "templates" (the set of questions, their names and descriptions, etc.), and other users fill out "forms" (their specific answers) using these templates (e.g., enter or select values in the fields).

### Warning: The implementation of the Cloudinary SDK is a modified version that i made for just to inject the HttpContext and avoid early instantiation of the field.
